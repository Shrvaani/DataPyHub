## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find a variety of projects that showcase the application of data science techniques in real-world scenarios. These projects cover areas such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning modeling, and data visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Projects

Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

1. [Python-based Weather Prediction](https://github.com/Shrvaani/DataPyHub/tree/Python_Based_Weather_Prediction): Weather forecasting with Python involves using historical weather data and Time Series Forecasting techniques to predict future weather conditions.
2. [IPL Data Analysis with Python](https://github.com/Shrvaani/DataPyHub/tree/Python_Based_Analysis_of_IPL): Utilizing Python's data science capabilities, we delve into a comprehensive analysis of IPL data. Leveraging various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly, we analyze team performance and visualize the findings to gain actionable insights.
3. [Instagram Data Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/Shrvaani/DataPyHub/tree/Python_Analyzing-Instagram-Reach): This project analyzes Instagram data using Python. It includes data visualization, text analysis (WordCloud), and machine learning-based engagement prediction using a Passive Aggressive Regressor.

Each project folder contains its own README.md file with detailed information about the project, including its objectives, methodologies, datasets used, and implementation details.
