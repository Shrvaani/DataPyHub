# Instagram Data Analysis and Prediction

Welcome to the DataPyHub! This repository contains a collection of projects related to data science and visualization using Python. Each project focuses on data analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques.

## Overview

This project analyzes Instagram data using Python. It includes data visualization, text analysis (WordCloud), and machine learning-based engagement prediction using a Passive Aggressive Regressor.

## Features

1. Data Preprocessing: Reads and processes Instagram dataset.
2. Data Visualization: Uses Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for insights.
3. Text Analysis: Generates a WordCloud to visualize common words.
4. Machine Learning: Predicts Instagram engagement using Passive Aggressive Regressor.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly wordcloud scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset used is Instagram.csv, which contains:

1. Post details (captions, likes, comments, etc.).
2. Engagement metrics (likes, shares, etc.).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Ensure Instagram.csv is in the correct directory.
3. Run the script using: python instagram_analysis.py
4. Follow the visualizations and predictions.

## Output

1. Data insights and visualizations.
2. WordCloud of common Instagram captions.
3. Machine learning predictions on engagement.
